# Prediction Game
## Instructions: 
### In this game, the computer will randomly select a letter from the Alphabete. You, the user, will have 9 guesses to try to guess what letter was chosen. Guess correctly and you will get a point. Run out of guesses however and a lose will be earned.

### Projects Main Focus
#### I had learned javascript in a bootcamp and wanted to test me knowledge in it again. We created a similar game. Little improvements I did from the original game were:
* including the use of arrow functions
* adding a "guessed letters" array to show the user the letters they had already guessed
* overall clean code

### Languages/Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* GoogleFonts
